Iris Flower Data Analysis Project

 Analysis Includes:

Data Exploration: Load and understand the Iris dataset

Statistical Summary: Compare measurements across species

Visualizations: Four different plot types showing patterns and relationships

Correlation Analysis: Discover hidden relationships between features

Visualizations Created:

Line Chart - Feature trends across flower samples

Bar Chart - Average petal length by species

Histogram - Distribution of sepal lengths

Scatter Plot - Relationship between sepal and petal length

Heatmap - Correlation between all flower features

 Key Findings

Clear Species Separation: Each Iris species has distinct measurement patterns

Petal Patterns: Strong correlation between petal length and width

Size Variations: Virginica has the largest flowers, Setosa the smallest

Measurement Consistency: Remarkably consistent patterns within each species
